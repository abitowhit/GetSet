# GetSet
247Coding.com - Class builder code and website for building classes. You can find video links on usage and functionality including zip download at http://247Coding.com.

StoryLine: Coding for a living requires tedious and redundant coding. To simplify this process I have created this application suite which allows you to type in variables and create the get-sets to build instant classes that you can cut and paste into your code behind. To take this a step further, I wanted the ability to take a database table and create a class based from it. By adding valid connection string information, you can connect to a database via the website attached and build an entire class based off of the database table you are connecting to. Some scrubbing may be required for your database cardinal types, I added in some of the most used. To take it yet one step further, I included both msSQL and mySQL compatibility.

Enter in variables and submit for instant simple class creation.
 Create a class directly from SQL or MySQL tables. Includes aspx website. If you use the code, find it useful, please give credit where credit is due. I spent many hours pouring over this to make it functional. ABitOWhit...
