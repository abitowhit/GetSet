## Overview
Coding for a living requires tedious and redundant coding. To simplify this process I have created this application suite which allows you to type in variables and create the get-sets to build instant classes that you can cut and paste into your code behind. 

To take this a step further, I wanted the ability to take a database table and create a class based from it. By adding valid connection string information, you can connect to a database via the website attached and build an entire class based off of the database table you are connecting to. Some scrubbing may be required for your database cardinal types, I added in some of the most used. 

To take it yet one step further, I included both msSQL and mySQL compatibility.

In its simplest form, simply enter in variables and submit for instant simple class creation.
Create a class directly from SQL or MySQL tables by adding a connection string, database and table. 

Includes the entire aspx website. 

If you use the code, find it useful, please give credit where credit is due. 

I spent many hours pouring over this to make it functional. ABitOWhit...
